                        By asking to ask like that, you're wasting time asking for permission to ask, when you could have just asked the question in the first place. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, by asking a vague question like "Does anyone here know about computers?", you're forcing everyone to ask you to clarify what you mean, and then wait for you to ask a more specific question related to your problem.

                    <p>
                        Asking immediately allows anyone who sees the question to answer it more immediately, and allows you to get your answer sooner. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By asking a more specific question, you're also allowing people to answer your question more easily, and you're not wasting anyone's time by forcing them to ask you to clarify what you mean.
