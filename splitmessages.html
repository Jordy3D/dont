                            Tim had to wait for Keith to finish typing everything before he could start thinking about
                            any
                            sort of response to the question.

                            Rather than being able to read it all at once, and not knowing
                            when Keith was going to stop typing, Tim had to wait for the message to finish before he
                            could
                            start thinking about it.

                            It may seem like it takes more time to type out a longer message, but it actually takes less
                            time overall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tim can start thinking about the question as soon as he sees it, and can start
                            typing a response while Keith is still typing the rest of the message.
