                            Tim was providing support to Keith with a problem he was having, trying to figure out what was wrong. Keith fixed the problem, but didn't tell Tim what the solution was.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result, Tim doesn't know what the resolution was, and can't help anyone else who might have the same problem, or even help Keith again if he has the same problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If this was a public forum, then anyone else who has the same problem won't be able to find the solution either.
                        </p>

                    <div class="script">
                        <p>
                            Because Keith told Tim what the solution was, Tim can now help anyone else who has the same problem, or add the solution to a combined knowledge base or general recommendation for the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If this was in a public forum, then even more people can benefit from the solution, as it would be recorded for anyone to find.
